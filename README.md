# Zomato Restaurant Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview

As part of my onboarding assignment with Zomato's BI Analytics Team, I conducted a **Restaurant Analysis** using sample data provided by the company. The goal was to uncover key insights into restaurant performance across cities, identify patterns in ratings, and provide actionable business recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and revenue growth.

This project was completed in **Power BI**, leveraging visualization and analytical techniques to extract value from the data.

## 📌 Key Findings

### 1. 📍 Average Restaurant Rating by City


- Cities like **Kundapura, Kochi, and Warangal** rank highest in customer satisfaction with average ratings above 3.6.
- On the flip side, **Hyderabad (Abids & Koti), Arambagh, and Palakkad** show lower average ratings, highlighting potential areas for quality improvement.
  
**Takeaway:**  
City-specific preferences and expectations significantly influence restaurant ratings. Understanding local customer behavior can help tailor service and menu offerings for better satisfaction.

#### 📌 Recommendations:
- **City-Specific Strategies:** Customize services based on regional preferences to elevate customer satisfaction.
